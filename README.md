# bootstrap-transparent-containers

This is technically how to make transparent rows in Bootstrap, as well as a transparent navbar and sticky footer.

This example is shown with a background image, but you can also use a background color, just add background-color and remove background: url and background-size from the html selector in the css file.

You can change the opacity and the color of the transparent containers by editing background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8) in div.row, .footer, and .navbar.
